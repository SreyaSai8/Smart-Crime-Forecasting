# Smart-Crime-Forecasting
Smart crime forecasting plays a vital role in enhancing urban safety by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to predict criminal activities and improve policing strategies. As cities grow and urbanization increases, law enforcement agencies face challenges in ensuring public safety. Traditional crime prediction methods often lack the ability to analyze large volumes of data and identify complex patterns within criminal activity. This paper presents a smart crime forecasting system that utilizes advanced ML algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast crime incidents in urban environments. By integrating historical crime data with contextual factors like socio-economic variables, urban infrastructure, and environmental conditions, the model improves prediction accuracy and provides actionable insights into potential crime hotspots. The study highlights the importance of incorporating real-time data and contextual covariates to optimize crime forecasting models. The results indicate that ML algorithms, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forest and deep learning models like LSTM, significantly outperform traditional prediction techniques in both accuracy and scalability. This research contributes to the development of smarter, data-driven policing strategies, offering law enforcement agencies the tools needed to prevent crimes before they occur, ultimately fostering safer cities for residents and visitors alike.
